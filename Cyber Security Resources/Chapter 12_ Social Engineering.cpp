/** Refresher Pad:

    Social Engineering, apart of the recon phase, is another excellent way to gather information. Social engineering involves 
    the use of tactics in order to probe and fish data out of people through social means.

    Social Engineering Attacks:

        Piggybacking & Tailgating:

            Piggybacknig and tailgating is the act of impersonating as a legitamet official of a facility, following them inside the facility.
            The difference between piggybacking and tailgating is that piggybacking is consentual, whereas tailgating is not. Tailgating you simply 
            follow the individual into the facility as if you were one of their own, without their consent and awareness.

        Phising:

            Phising tactics involve the use of fradulennt attempts, normally done digitally through trojans, displaying false information in an attemp to 
            steal sensitive information about the end-user.

        Shoulder Surfing:

            As the name would suggest, shoulder surffing involves watching over someone's shoulder in order to steal information, and sadly, is a very practical 
            form of attack that is quite successful.
        
        Spear Phising:

            Spear phising involves an attacker sending legitamate emails as if they were from a legitamate source, stealing credentials from the replier.

        Reverse Social Engineering:

            Unlike normal social engineering tactics that involve indirect contact with their targets, reverse engineering attacks involve direct contact. A good example of this would be
            pretending to be some form of human resources or some kind of customer support for staff, creating situations where the staff needs to contact the attacker and give credentials.
        
        Vishing:

            Vishing involves via phone automated voice messages to phish credentials.

        Smishing:

            The act of using text/SMS messages to phish sensitive information from end-users.

        Typo Squatting:

            Typo squatting is a social engineering technique that takes advantage of the lazy aspects of the brain, essentially tricking users into using a 
            fraudulent link with a typo in it in order to infect the system. Think of it like this, read the two links "gooogle.com" and "google.com". For a 
            split second you probably glanced at it quickly thought they were spelled the same. The attack takes advantage of that and uses it to trick the user 
            into accessing the link.

        ClickJacking:

            ClickJacking is social engineering attack that places fradulent links under legitamate ones.


    Security Measures:

        Bellow are the following security measures, or deterrent controls that help mitigate against a variety of security threats.

        Technical Measures:

            Technical measures involve the use of technologival means to help prevent attacks: IDS's, firewalls, etc etc.
        
        Physical Measures:

            Mantrap doors, security guards, electric fences, are all solid examples of physical measures that help deter and mitigage against seecurity threats.

        Operational Measures:

            Operational measures involve the overseeing and training of staff to deter/mitigate security related threats through proper run down of security protocols.

            Preventing Email Phising attacks:

                The following methods on an operational level can be used to prevent email phising attacks:
                
                    * Ensure all emails are from a legitamate source
                    * Verify all links before clicking them
                    * Check grammar and spelling of emails
        
        Security Controls:

        Bellow are the following security controls which act as another means of security measures to enable proper security within a system

        Preventive:

            Preventative security controls involve the user of: technical, physical, and operational methods in order to provide better security.
        
        Detective:

            Detective security controls are applied during an incident response plan, used by incident response teams to investigate a security breach.

        Corrective:

            Corrective measure security controls revolve around disaster recovery plans, designed to focus all assets into data recovery should a system be compromised.

        Administrative:

            Administrative security controls are simply administrators monitoring and managing a facility, as well as the proper training of staff to follow all security 
            protocols. Administrative controls are not provided to security guards.

        Compensating Security Controls:

            Compensating security controls provide another means to authenticate should a legitamate user not have suffecient credentials.

        Security Conncepts:

            Implicit Deny:

                Implicit deny is the denial of access to unauthorized users 

            Security by Obscurity:

                Security by obscurity is one of the weakest forms of security, in that it uses secrets, or a form of "code" to preserve sensitive information. A good 
                example would be the use of a certain slang word in order to refference something, or a joke for example. A joke is only funny when someone gets and 
                understands the joke. However if the joke were about someone in particular, an inside joke and they caught on to it, it could lead to the compromising 
                of the insdie joke, or in a sense of system security, the compromising of the whole systems. 

            Diversity in Defense:

                Diversity in defense is utilizing a variety of different security systems to mitigate security threats 
                as well as through attackers off. Security systems less known will have very few exploits discovered, which will increase the milage an attacker has to 
                go through in order to compromise the system.

            Defense in Depth:

                Defense in depth is the deployment of multiple layers of security controls throughout information systems

            Control Diversity:

                Control divesity is the implementation of different security control types/mechanisms in order to better mitigate security threats.
                
            Principle of least privelege(PoLP or POLP):

                PoLP or POLP, principle of least privelage, is essentially the whole concept of a true management system that dictates how resouces are portioned to 
                users.
