    Understanding Cloud Computing Security:

        Now that we've covered all we need to know about the basics of attacking various system types and IoT devices, 
        lets go over the basics of cloud computing security. We will be going over the NIST reference model, also known 
        as the National Institutes of Standards Technology.

    NIST Reference Models:
        
        The NIST reference model covers the basic behavior traits and handling of cloud services, which will give us a better 
        understanding of cloud security.

        Cloud Carrier:

            The cloud carrier model handles the essential connectivity and communication between client and server/provider, allow the 
            exchange of data.

        Cloud Consumer:

            Cloud consumer is the end-user, the client.

        Cloud Provider:

            The server side end, or the provider that distributes the service.

        Cloud Broker:

            Serving as the bridge between Provider and Consumer, brokers help providers sell their cloud based services, often sometimes 
            giving deals and offers the provider might have to convince the consumer to purchase the product. Essentially the house broker 
            for cloud services. Cloud broker is also known as Cloud Access Security Broker(CASB)

        Cloud Auditor:

            An inspector that makes sure all protocols are being followed by cloud service providers.

    Cloud Computing Models:

        Understanding the basic Cloud computing infrastructures is key to understanding cloud security.

        IAAS:

            The IAAS infrastructure refers to cloud providers hosting virtualized services via hardward/software dedicated servers. An simple, but,
            good example of this is google servers hosting google docs, giving people free access to a basic microsoft office for free.

        IAAS Network:

            IAAS Network infrastructures provide DNS's, essentially domain names or websites where people can host their websites on their server, like 
            how godaddy does. These infrastructues also offer load balancing, which is essentially an access point of multiple servers operating behind the 
            main one. Useful for storing more sensitive files elsewhere.

        PAAS:

            Another breed of IAAS, PAAS is an infrastructure that essentially provides tools meant for application development, making the process a lot smoother 
            rather than going out and figuring out how to install certain tool, for example, compilers, which can be annoying to install on windows machines, can be 
            offered easily and be used very easily. A lot of time in software development is shockingly wasted on annoying installation processes.

        SAAS & SAAS:

            Of the most confusing infrastructres to remember, SAAS stands for "Software As A Service" as well as "Storage As A Service" architecture. Software as a service 
            architecture refers to cloud services that host and provide accesss to application, such as google play store for example. Storage as a service essentially is 
            online storage, such as google drive for example, where you can virtually store your data on their servers.

        CAAS:

            Communication as a service architecture offers services that enable various forms of communication, whether it be things like facebook messenger or whats app..
        
        NAAS:

            Network as a service infrastructures are essentially internet service providers, providing home networks to people.

        MAAS:

            Monitoring as a service infrastructures provide monitoring services such as intrusion detection systems and CCTV systems for example.

        Security As A Service(SECaaS):

            SECaaS are essentially cloud porivders that provide security related products to users via cloud service. A good example of this are VPN service.

    Cloud Security benefits and protections:

        The following are all security benefits and protections in cloud security except VM Sprawl

        * CASB
        * SECaaS
        * VM isolation
