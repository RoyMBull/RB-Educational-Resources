    What is a deterent control?:

        Deterent controls are added layers of defense mechanisms designed to mitigate a variety of security 
        threats whether they be physical measures: Security guards, biometric scanners, etc etc, or a 
        technological implementations to prevent security threats such as an IDS system that monitotrs network 
        activity and a variety of diferent sequence patterns in order to discern and mitigate network attacks as 
        well as malicious activity that might occur on a network and take set programmable actions

        Security Signs such as a "No Trespassing sign" are forms of deterrent controls.

    What is FISMA/Information Security Policies?:

        Information security policies, also known as FISMA, enacted in 2002, require all federal agencies to implement a set of security 
        policies in order to protect sensitive data. A collective of all security policies for different types of federal agencies is found 
        on the NIST-800-53 list, each assessed under OSSEM tests to certify them before implementation.

    What is are the different Security Policy types?:

        The 3 differnt, and most basic security policies are: Internet security policies, special access policies, and network connection
        policies.

        Information Security Policy:

            Information security policies dictate what end-users are able to do, either on the network, or 
            the system itself. A good example of this is how school networks block certain sites, requring 
            students to use a proxy in order to acces certain sites, or how a library computer restricts 
            what people can download on them.

            ISP/ASU's consent to monitoring and auditing processes used by organizations.

        Special Access Policy:

            Special access policies are a means to safely handle sensitive data. A good example of this is 
            using a set of public and private keys to encrypt and handle the exchange of sensitive data, which
            better dictates who is and who is not meant to access senstive data.

        Network Connection Policy:

            Network connection policies dictate who can access a network, often done through MAC address filtering, 
            to best restrict access to a network
        
        Security Policies:

        Acceptable User Policy(AUP): THIS IS BASICALLY A DIFFERENT ABBREVIATION FOR INTERNET CONNECTION POLICY(ISP)

            AUP's, or Acceptable user policies are essentially internet security policies which dictate what users can and cannot do on the network and their 
            respoective systems.

        Privacy Policy:

            Privacy policies reffer to the handling of authentication and authorization, as well as the methods involved in secure communications by websites. 
            A good example would be websites or web services sanitizing user input in order to mitigate against XSS and SQL injection base attacks, or DDOS 
            protection on game servers.

        Spearation of Duties(SOD or SoD):

            Sod/SOD, separation of duties reffers to the splitting of roles and dutie in a facility to better mitigate against security threats, as well as avoid 
            massive scale attacks that could compromise the entire system. Splitting roles allows companies to implement a variety of security measures fit for 
            those roles, allowing them to better preserve security.

        Code of Ethics Policy:

            A code of ethics policy is a form of written agreement, which states staff will undergo monitoring and inspection to make sure all security protocols 
            are being followed.

        Business Parthners Agreement(BPA):

            A BPA, business parthners agreement is made between two organizations working together, which could lead to reciprocal sites, which would allow business 
            parthners to back up eachothers data.
    
        Interconnection Security Agreemennt(ISA):

            ISA, interconnection security agreement specifies the requirements needed to maintain secure data communications, which also correlates to one of OWASP's 
            top 10 IoT vulnerabilities.

        Memorandum of Understanding or Agreement(MOU):

            MOU's are a more formal form of agreement than a handshake, however is not legally binding like a non disclosure agreement(NDA)

        Non-Disclosure Agreement(NDA):

            NDA, or non-disclosure agreements, are used in scenarios, like an extranet for example, where an organization or private resource establishes a 
            formal written agreement to exchange information and resources with third parties, third parties agreeing to not disclose any of that information 
            to any sources unless approved by the organization itself.

        TOS:

            TOS, terms of service, are the rules and regulations reguarding web services and software products that guidline what end-users may and may not do with the 
            software.

    What are the different types of security methods?

        There are 5 different types of security methods: Integrity, BCP, BIA, MID, and DIR.
        
        Integrity:

            One of the most important types of security methods, integrity methods ensure the reliability 
            and consistency of data across it's life span. Over the course any data's lifespan, the data needs to 
            be accurate and consistent, especially when being handled. Lets say for example, SONY's PSN service, when 
            you purchase a game, that purchase will be licencesd to your account, where that information, assuming
            the correct Special access security policies are in place, will be handle and stored in their data bases.
            The data being handled needs to be processed correctly, otherwise any purchse you've made, won't be licesnesd 
            to your account properly. If you delete an application for a digitally purchased game, the system won't recognize you've
            purchased it, meaning you won't have the ability to safely redownload the game should.

        Message Authenticity:

            Message authenticity is sort of similar like integrity in cyber security, where intrgrity reffers to the validity and consistency of data
            throughout it's life cycle, message authenticity is much the same, excpet is for the user, and takes place during crypto data exchanges when the 
            user encrypts data via a private or public key.

        Confidentiality:

            Confidentiality protects the secrecy of data, information, or resources.
    
        Business Continuity Planning:

            BCP's consists of implementations of a variety of deterrent controls that help to mitigate 
            various security threats the federal establishment might be vulnerable to.

            BCP's main goal is to minimize the impact of disruptive events

        Business Impact Analysis:

            BIA's study the probably casualties that could take place should a successful compromise of 
            the federal establishment should take place, such as a high scale cyber attack for example, 
            or the DDOS of PSN servers, which consist of: MTD and DIR. But in order to do this, the federal 
            business must first deduce the most cirtical systems on a network that factor in the continuation 
            of services for the establishment.

            Types of Business Impacts:

                * Financial
                * Reputation

        Maximum Tolerable Downtime:

            When a system is compromised, agencies need to calculate how long systems can be down in order.

        Disaster Recovery Plans:

            Disaster recovery plans are a means to divert all resources into the recovery of sensitive data should there 
            be a compromise of sensitive data.

    What are the various assessment methods?:

        Before a set of security policies are set in place in a federal agency, they must first be assessed 
        and certified under OSSEM. These assessements are also re-conducted during security audits in order to 
        verify the maintaining of security policies set in place. The following assessment methods are:
        TOE, PP, ST, SFR, and EAL.

        Target of Evaluation:

            TOE is the device or system being assessed for evaluation
        
        Protection Profile:

            Protection profiles ensure the said TOE being assessed is following criteria neccessary to be 
            successfully certified for that particular device or system. For example, if assessing the database of a facility that holds end-user 
            credit card information, a security auditer might check if the web application of such facility is 
            succeptible to the following attacks: Cross site scripting or SQL injection attacks to check if user 
            input is validated and properly sanitized.

        Security Targets:

            Security targets are basically all the criteria that make up a proper protection profile to evaluate whether or not 
            a said TOE. They are also known as security templates.

        Security Function Requirements:

            SFR assessments evaluate proposals of new implementations of security protocols a federal agency wishes to establish

        Evaluation Assurance Levels:  

            Defines how a device or system is to be tested and how thouroughly.

        Baseline: 

            Baselines define the minimum performance value criteria: computer systems, software products, etc etc, must meet.

    What are the Phases of a Pen-Test?:

        During a penetration test, there are 5 phases you must properly go through: reconnissance, scanning and enumeration, gaining access,
        maintaining access, and covering tracks.

        Reconnissance Phase:

            The first phase of a penetration test is the recon phase. During the recon phase of a penetration test you'll be either actively or passively gathering 
            as much information about your target after proper assessment of the target. Essentially this is the footprinting phase.

            Active Reconnissance:

                Actve recon consists of gathering information about a target through normal means of interaction, requiring the 
                attacker to engage the system or facility in order to gain information about vulnerabilities in the system.
                Leaving a backdoor on an employees system or social engineering is a good way to gather information about a system.

            Passive Reconnissance:

                Passive recon consists of gathering information about a target without interacting with the system, which is prefferable
                in order to avoid detection. Passive scanning such as monitoring packet data in the air is a good example of this.

        Scanning and Enumeration Phase:

            The second phase of a penetration test involves gathering in depth information about the target, such as: vulnerabilities, systems on networks, etc etc. 
            Essentially this is the phase where a lot of in depth port scanning occurs.
        
        Gaining Access Phase:

            After modeling out all possible vulnerabilities, the next step is to begin testing the system against them.
        
        Maintaining Access:

            Maintaining Access is the 4th phase of a penetration test. During this phase, the attacker leaves backdoors in the system as a means to get back in, potentially 
            creating botnetworks they can use to help spread their level of access accross the network.

        Covering Tracks:

            The last and final phase of a penetration test is covering all tracks, which involve proper understanding of the attacks methods being used in order to understand how 
            to cover tracks. For example modifying log files will help prevent detection, which will allow you to essentially maintain access to the target system.
    
    What are the different kinds of Box Tests?:

        During a penetration test you'll perform either of the following box tests, or a combination of them in 
        order to plan out how you'll approach the system when conducting your test. The following possible box tests
        are: white, black, and gray.

        White-Box:

            White-Box tests are conducted internally on a system, where the attacker has authorization and access to the system.
            
        Black-Box:

            Black-Box tests are conducted externally on a system, often observing behavior of the system from the outside or various other 
            means due to lack of authorization and access to the system. Typically crackers and malicious attackers use these methods.

        Gray-Box:

            Gray-Box tests are conducted in a special case, where lets say for example, the attacker is authorized, but based on the 
            scope of the test outlined in the assessment phase of the attack, does not have access to the system, and might have to 
            utilize black-box tests in order to perform a successful pen-test on the system 

            In a gray box test, only part of the internal system is known and accessible to the tester.

        Double-Blind-Test:

            DBT tests involve a lot of passive behavior during a penetration test: dumpster diving, monitoring staff schedules, accessing public records, all
            in an attempt to simulate a real attack on a client organization. In this scenario the attacker is given no information about the organization or 
            systems.

    Computer Security Incident Response Team:

        CSIRT is an incident response team that provides services to different federal agencies that have had some sort of a 
        security casuality. CSIRT will conduct forensics in order to pinpoit what and how the attack was successful on their 
        systems.

        Security Operations Center(SOC or SoC):

            A security operations center manages various incident response teams that respond to a variety of different security incidents related 
            to facilities related to the department of homeland security.

    Service Oriented Architechture:

        SOA records are a collective of authority records distributed to domain names, containing information about zones belonging 
        to them. SOA records contain the following information/paramaters about the zones: refresh, serial, retry, and expire.

        If at any point should a primary SO be higher than that of the secondary SOA records, the secondary name servers will request a zone transfer 
        from them.
        
        Serial:

            Contains information about the version of the server, incrementing as the version is updated/modified.

        Refresh:

            The refresh value of a SOA record for a domain name indicates how long/often the server will check for updates
        
        
        Retry:

            This value indicates how a the server will attempt a request.

        Expire:

            This value indicates how long the server will wait before terminating a connection.

        TTL:

            The time to live for SOA records

        The following tools can do zone transfers
          
            A. NSLookup
            C. Dig
            D. Sam Spade
            E. Host

    Extra Bits of Information:

        Payment card industry(PCI):

            PCI manages all transactions made via credt/debit card worldwide, and deploys a variety of guidelines, sort of 
            Personal profile that describes how to protect PII, personal identifiable information during transaction processes.

        Risk Equation:

            The risk equation, when assessing risk is the risk, equivalent to the threat times the number of vulnerabilities.
        
        NPC organization:

            The NPC is an organization that conducts investigations on cyber crime activity around the U.S.

        18 U.S.C par 1030:

            Monotors fraud dna related activity for email and maill fraud activity.  

        The following are all protected health information:

        * Phone numbers
        * medical record numbers
        * email address
        * vehicle identifiers
        * web URLs
        * IP address numbers
        * Biometric identifiers
        * Photographic images
