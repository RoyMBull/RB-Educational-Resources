/** Intro to SNORT IDS
    
    How to install snort on Linux:

        sudo apt-get install snort  
        * Next move to snort in the /etc directo
    
    Snort.Conf:

        Hover over to the snort.conf file to view the configuration settings.
        
        ipvar HONE_NET:

            This sets the snort IDS to monitor the IP address of the network you're on

        include $RULE_PATH/RULEFILE.rules:

            In the snort configuration file, this is how you include a set of rules for the IDS to use 
                EX:
                    include $RULE_PATH/MYRULES.rules

    SNORT Syntax and Rule Actions:

         Syntax:

            <Rule Action> <Protocol> <Source IP Address> <Direction Operator> <Destination IP Address> <Destination Port>(Rule Options)
            
            EX:

                The following fule below states that if there is any TCP connection from any soure IP/Port attempting to 
                communicate with the network, to respond with a message.

                    alet tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 21 (msg: "FTP connection attempt"; sid 1000001; rev:1;)

            EX2:

                Alerts when a SSH connection attempt is made on port 22
                
                    alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.4 22 (msg: "Write Message")
            
            EX3:

                Alerts when specific website is visited. This is how an IDS blocks certain websites someone can visit on a network
                
                    alert tcp any any -> $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP PORTS (msg: "Write Message")

            EX
                

        Rule Actions:

            alert: 
                
                Upon discovery of malicious activity in network traffic, the IDS will generate an alert 
                and then presume to log and report the activity for the administrator to sort over.
            
            log:

                Upon discovery of malicious activity in network traffic, the IDS will simply log the incident 
                for the administrator to sort over, no alert involved.

            pass:

                The IDS will perform a true negative and simply ignore the packet activity

            activate:

                Upon discovery of malicious activity in network traffic, the IDS will perform an alert action, 
                which will also log the incident. The IDS will then perform an action, or a dynamic rule, in response 
                to the discovered activity. A good example of this would be redirecting the traffic off the network or 
                taking the service down for a period of time.

            dynamic:

                A conditional rule that only activates when called by the activate. 

            drop:

                Upon discovery of malicious activity in network traffic, the IDS will block the traffic/packet data, 
                and the presume to log it's findings in the IDS log  
            
            reject:

                Upon discovery of malicious activity in network traffic, the IDS will block the traffic/packet data, 
                and the presume to send a TCP packet with the reset flag set. 

            sdrop:

                Upon discovery of malicious activity in network traffic, the IDS will only block the traffic/packet data, 
                it will not log it. 

        Source/Destination IP Address: 

            $HOME_NET:
                
                Sets the source IP address
            
            $EXTERNAL_NET:

                Sets the destination IP address
        
        Source/Destination Port:

            any: 

                Sets it to any port

        Direction Operator:

            ->:
                
                Indicates one way traffic
            
            <>:

                Indicates bidirectional traffic                

        Rule Options:

            Rule options are stored in () at the end of your rule
            general:

                These options provide information about aboutt the rule but do not have any affect during detection 
            
            Payload:

                These options all look for data inside the packet payload and can be inter-related.
            
            non-payload:

                These options look for non-payload data. 

            post-detection:

                These options are rule specific triggers that happen after a rule has "fired". 

            msg:
                
                Writes a message 

            content:

                Specifies a content, such as a DNS for example for if a specific website is visited
            
            sid:

                An ID specific to the incident reported
            
            nocase: 

                Observes a string without case sensitivity

            rev:

                the revision number of the rule (can leave it one or opt it out)

        Protocol:

            SNORT works with the following network protocols

                * TCP
                * UDP
                * ICMP
                * IP 
    
    Validating the configuration:

        snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

    Starting the SNORT IDS: 

        snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf  #Remove the -q to get more information

    Running the IDS in the background of the system:

        snort -D -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -l /var/log/snort/

    * In order to run snort in packet logged mode use the following command 
                ./snort -dev -l ./log
