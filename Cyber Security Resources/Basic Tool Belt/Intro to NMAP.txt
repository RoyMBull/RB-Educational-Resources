/** Intro to NMAP
    
    TIP: * NMAP is easily detected for it is a noisy scanner.
         * Free website to practice NMAP scans are -> scanme.nmap.org
         * NMAP can scan 6500 ports, 1000 the base level by  default
         * You can perform a scan via the IP address or the domain name of a target
    
    NMAP:

        Commands/Options:

            nmap: The NMAP command 
            -v: Prints the version number of the server as well as more information about the scan.
                You can use two v's to be even more verbose with your scans.
            -A: Enables OS and version detection, also known as an aggressive scan 
            -help: Displays all teh options available for NMAP 
            -oG: Formats the output of the data from the scan 
            -p: Scans the port of a target
            -F: fast scan, scanning most commonly targeted ports. Scans 100 ports
            -sV: Scans the version of the OS 
            -sC: Scans with default NSE scripts (Nmap Scripting Engine) to automate the scan
            -O: Remote OS detection using TCP/IP stack fingerprinting
            -traceroute: Performs a traceroute command
            -sn or -PI: Used to identify live targets on a subnet/or network via fast scan
            -open: Provides only open ports from a target
            -sl: Performs a IDLE scan in NMAP
            NMAP -P 192.168.1-5 (1-5 is the range of subnets): Scanning Multiple Subnets with NMAP 
            -oX: Nmap option that outputs the results in XML format
            -sO: to see which ports have been left open on a network when using NMAP switches
            Nmap -O -p80: can be used to perform stack fingerprinting in NMAP
        
        States:

            Upon a scan, there is the State colum, which indicates teh state of a port

            Filtered: 
                If shown, indicates the port is filtered, meaning any packets 
                sent to the port will be blocked by the firewall of the server in place.
            
            Open:

                Indicates the port is open
        
        Port:

            Upon a scan, there is the port colum, which indicates the port number of a port found 
        
        Service:

            Upon a scan, there is the service colum which indicates what type of service is running on a 
            live port.


    How to initialize a scan:

        In order to initiate a scan, enter the nmap command, followed by either the domain name 
        or IP address of the target. By default, unless specified, NMAP will scan 1000 ports.
            
            EX:
                nmap scan.nmap.org 
    
    How to scan a set of IP ranges:

        NMAP allows you to scan a set of IP ranges of a target. To scan IP ranges use the following command 

        EX: 

            nmap -oG - 192.168.1.0-255 -vv 

    Scanning ports:

        After discovering live ports on a system, you can use the -p option to scan the live port. 

        EX: 
            nmap -oG 192.168.1.0-255 -p 22 -vv 
        
        OR: 

            nmap scanme.nmap.org -p 22 
    
    Scanning OS versions of the OS:

        nmap -A scanme.nmap.org

    Finding services/service versions of an OS:

        nmap -sV scanme.nmap.org

    How to perform a fast scan: 

        nmap -F scanme.nmap.org
    
    How to scan multiple targets:

        nmap -F scanme.nmap.org www.google.com
