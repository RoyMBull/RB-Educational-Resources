        Assessment Phase:

            The assesment phase of a penetration test is all about scoping and feeling out, knowing your target. You begin 
            by assessing the kind of scope of attack the client needs launched, as well as the means to go about the attack. 
            In some cases you'll be given lots of information to work with and plan out your attack, you might even have access 
            to the system. However, in some cases the opposite will occur, requiring you to gather all sorts of information 
            about your target manually in order to assess how you need to go about the attack, which will change
            your recon phase approach as well as your boxt test method.

        Reconnissance Phase:

            During the recon phase of a penetration test you'll be either actively or passively gathering as much information 
            about your target after proper assessment of the target. 

            Active Reconnissance:

                Actve recon consists of gathering information about a target through normal means of interaction, requiring the 
                attacker to engage the system or facility in order to gain information about vulnerabilities in the system.
                Leaving a backdoor on an employees system or social engineering is a good way to gather information about a system.

            Passive Reconnissance:

                Passive recon consists of gathering information about a target without interacting with the system, which is prefferable
                in order to avoid detection. Passive scanning such as monitoring packet data in the air is a good example of this.

        Thread Modeling and Vulnerability Identification Phase:

            After the recon phase of a pen-test, the pentester begins to map out all possible vulnerabilities the system 
            may have.

        Exploitation Phase:

            After modeling out all possible vulnerabilities, the next step is to begin testing the system against them.
        
        Post-Exploitation Phase:

            After testing the system against all possiible vulnerabilties from the thread moddeling phase, the next step of the 
            pentest phase is to document the tests: the tests made, discovered vulnerabilities, people involved in the test, all documented
            and writtenn for the executive of the agency.

        Reporting Phase;

            After documenting the pen-test, report the document.

        Resolution and re-testing phase:

            The final phase of the test after the documentation process, having the documentation looked over and having the client 
            decide whether they will acknowledge the risks discovered and patch them, or simply ignore them and risk the casualties should 
            these vulnerabilities be exploited by a real attacker.
