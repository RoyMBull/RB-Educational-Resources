/** Risk Management

    Incident Response Plan:

        IRP's, incident response plans, are the phases taken by incident response teams after a system compromise occurs at a facility.

        When responding to an incident the first thing that should be done is securing the crime scene.

        When collecting evidence from the crime scene, chain of custody should be performed.

        Preparation occurs during, but mostly before the actual execution of the ISP plan.

        Charactersistics for picking personel for incident response teams:

        * Training 
        * Experience
        
        Standards for submitting evidence into criminal and civil court cases:

        * Federal rules of evidence
        * Federal rules of civil procedure

        Phases:

            Preparation:

                The preparation phase of an indidcnet response plan assesses the causes of the breach by the client, as well as any points of contact and other assests.

            Identification: 

                The next step is the identification phase, identifying the threat and gathering as much information about it as possible

            Containment, Eradication, & Recovery(These occur in order):

                After identifying the threat and assessing as much information about it as possible, the security threat is then quarentiened, 
                where it is then eradicated after proper examination. The next step after this is to begin a DRP, which is a disaster recovery plan,
                where assests are pooled into data recovery if sensitive data was either corrupted or lost on current systems.

            Lessons Learned:

                During this phase, everything has returned to normal. The organization recovering from the attacks studies what vulnerabilities they might 
                have had that made the attack permissable, as well as all information about the security breach, planning a variety of deter methods that 
                help mitigate against it in the future.

            The recovery phase of an ISP is when operations return to normal(SEPARATE THE 3 IN ONE PHASES OF ISP)


    Risk Analysis:
        
        Bellow are the various forms of risk analysis that are involved during the lifespan of a project, from when it is conecptualized, ongoing, followed by 
        completion.

        Quantitative Analysis:

            Quantitative analysis involves analyzing all the possible risks that could potentially be involved during a projects life span.

        Residual Analysis:

            Residual anaysis is the remaining risks after proper quantitatively analysis.

        Qualitative Analysis:

            Qualitative analysis focuses on the frequency of all possible risks to a project through it's lifespan.

            Qualitative analysis can also be deploye in delphi techniques, interviews, and focus groups.

        Cost Benefit Analysis:

            Cost benefit analyzis measures the costs of each action: accepting a risk, hiring staff, implementation of security measures, etc etc.

    Risk Formula/Equations:

        Bellow are the following risk formulas/equations associated with risk management/assessment

        Risk formula: 

            Risk = Probability X Threat 
        
        Anual Loss Expectancy:

            ALE, Annual Loss Expectancy, allows you to calculate the annual monetary loss associated with risks over the course of a year
            by using the SLE, single loss expectancy, and ARO, annual rate of occurance.
            
            Formula:

                ALE = SLE X ARO

        Single Loss Expectancy:

            SLE, single loss expectancy, measures the potential monetary loss associated with risks that occur each time to differnet assets

            Formula:

                SLE = asset value x exposure factor

                    Asset Value(AV):

                        AV, asset value, measures the value/worth of the asset to the organization, and is calculated based on tangible/and intangible 
                        values, expenses, and costs associated with the asset, and predicts the ammounn tof loss the organization would face should the asset 
                        no longer be prevalent for operations.

                    Exposure Factor(EF):

                        EF, exposure factor, is the percentage of asset value loss should a security breach occur due to risks associated with certain assets.

        Annualized rate of occurance:

            ARO, annualized rate of occurance, measures the frequency of threat occurances per year.       

    Alternate Processsing Facility:

        Alternate Processing facilities are ways to recover/and or backup data from facility sites

        Hot Site:

            Hot sites are remote sites that serve as a highly responsive back up. Should the main system go down, a back up one stored in a safe offsite location 
            will kick in, preserving all system operations.

        Warm Site:

            Warm Sites are back up systems designed to simply replace the main one entirely should they go down. Unlike hot sites, which are highly responsive and 
            kick into gear the moment the main system shuts down, warm sites just host all the key components and software needed to function as a new copy of the 
            system should it go down. I'ts responsive, but not as responsive as the hot site one.
        
        Cold Site:

            Cold sites involve refabricating the entire facility from the ground up.

            Commercial Cold Site:

                Commercial cold sites are rented places for use that can reduce the cost of facility fabrication

                These types of sites is also known as "shared sites".
        Mobile Site:    

            Mobile sites server as sort of, delivery truck for example, containing various hardware and software processes that can help preserve and support the main system.

        Mobile Recovery Site:

            Mobile recovery sites are mobile recovery site options for facilities that can serve as a: how, warm, or cold site.

        Dedicated Site:

            Dedicated sites are corporate owned facilities

        Reciprocal site

            Reciprocal sites are written forms of agreements that allow two organizations to back up eachothers data.
                                                                       
    General Information:

        Recovery Time Objective(RTO): THIS IS ESSENTIALLY ANOTHER ABBREVIATION FOR MAXIUM ALLOWABLE DOWNTIME

            Recovery time objective is essentially the same thing as maximum allowable downtime, which describes the maximum time a system can be down.

        Mean Time to Failure(MTTF):

            MTTR, mean time to failure, is factored to predict the failure rate of a product

        MTTR:   

            MTTR, mean time to respond, measures the amount of time it takes to control and mitigate a security threat, essentially timing IRP's, incidennt response plans.

        MTBF:

            MTBF, mean time between failure, is quality assurance testing, conditioning various sytems and software products in order to test how often systems fail,
            which is heavily sed in the safety and equipment designn of various systems for critical and complex assets.

        Delphi-Technique:

            Delphi-Technique is the assessment and making of a decision based on the studying of experts, in this case, can be applied to security audits on 
            administrative staff to make sure they're adhering to all security protocols.
