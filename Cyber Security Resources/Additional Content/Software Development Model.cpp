/** Software Development Model(SDLC)

    (SDLC) Model:

        The SDLC Model describes the phases that make up the production of software

        Roles:

            Planning Phase:

                Plannning Phase consists of assessing all the ideas of the client, followed by assessing all assets needed to complete the project: staff, 
                hardware, software, costs, etc etc

            Requirement Analysis Phase:

                The next stage of the phase is requirement analysis, which is essentially the gathering of all assets, and developing a plan on the inteded 
                resource to be used, but first checking with the client to make sure proposed methods follow up with the clients ideas
                
            Design and Prototyping:

                Upon approval, the nexxt phase is the prototyping phase, developing several prototypes, each being checked with the client until one can be 
                finalized, essentially the draft process.
                
            Software Development Phase:

                The next phase is the software development phase, where the production of all code for the software product is being worked on
                
            Software Testing Stage:

                Next is the testing and debugging phase, where all code is properly debugged.

            Implementation and Integration(Deployment Phase):

                Next phase is the implementation and integration phase, basically the deployment phase, which finalizes the completion of the product.
                
            Operations and Maintenance:
                    
                Last phase is the maintenance phase, which is essentially maintaining the product and performing a series of bugs and fixes, "patches" 
                over the life span of the product.

        Models:

            Above was the standard SDLC model, which has been around for a long time. Bellow are other implements of phases that take place in software development.

            Waterfall Model:

                The waterfall model is essentially the SDLC model, but with the ability to return to previous phases. During the SDLC model phases, returning to 
                previous phases is strictly prohibited

            V Shaped Model:

                The V Shaped model reffers to the documentation of constant prototyping/testing of software along side production of the software.

            Prototype Model:

                The prototype model reffers to the prototype phase of the SDLC model, which consists of developing prototypes in order to find one that the client 
                preffers.

            Spiral Model:

                The spiral model is a combination of the waterfall and prototype phase, constantly testing, debugging, and prototyping throughout the project, 
                keeping it well documented

            Interactive and incremental SDLC model:

                The interactive and incremental SDLC model reffers to essentially the maintenance phase of the SDLC model, and is essentially the process of 
                implementing or removing features via approval first.
                
            Agile Development Model:

                The agile development model is in a pure sense, the use of methods that help speed up the development of software with shorter development cycles.

            Magic Box Model:

                The magic box model reffers to a more speed up development cycle, typically used on products with a shorter development cycle, it's goal being to 
                allow code and databases to be malleble for easy edits and changes, while still trying to have the least amount of bugs in the product.

            Scrum Framework:

                The scrum framework, typically deployed in the agile model which focuses on a more faster pace of software development, focuses on:
                teamwork, accountability, and interactiveness in software development.
