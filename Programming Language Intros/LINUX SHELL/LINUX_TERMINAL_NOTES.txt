NOTE: When you create a file or directory, owener is also assigned ot a group

mkdir: Creates a directory
	EX: mkdir myname
rmdir: Removes a directory
	EXl rmdir myname
rm: removes a file

*: Wild card. This performs an action that will affect all things of the same type
	EX: rm *:WIll REMOVE ALL FILES
	    rmdir * WILL REMOVE ALL DIRECTORIES
	    rm *.jpg: WILL REMOVE ALL .JPG FILES
	    rmdir * Desktop: WILL REMOVE ALL DIRECTORIES OF THE SAME TYPE
touch: Creates a file (just add the type of file you wish to create at the end, ".cpp, .py", etc etc)
	EX: touch Bacon
cp: Coppies a file or directory
	EX: cp Bacon Bacon2 
mv: Moves a directory
	EX: mv Bacon (Directories name)/Bacon

grep: searches and checks a file, directory, or application
	EX: grep (the key word) Bacon(you can do this from MULTIPLE FILES)

diff: Compares the difference between 2 files and then displays those differences
	EX: diff Bacon Corn

passwd: Allows you to change your password

echo: allows you to print txt to the screen
	EX: echo Hello World
	EX(Echo a variable): echo $($lets the system know your variable is a variable)(varable)
				echo $name

Create a variable in the terminal: (variable)=(contents. NO SPACES ACCEPTABLE!!!!!)
	EX: name=hey
info: Looks up info about commands
	EX: info (your command as the second argumentls

ls >: shows you all the files you've created in a directory
	EX: ls > (your filename of choice to create with it's own type, ".cpp, .py", etc)

pwd >> : Shows you all the cd path's the user has taken
	EX: pwd >> (your filename of choice to create with it's own type, ".cpp, .py", etc)

sudo Breakdown:
s = super
u = user
do = do, as in do something
sudo = super user do

sudo: Grants system administravtive priveleges to the system. Must be used in higher level command executions
	EX: Deleting directories, installing updates and apps, etc etc, administrative priveleges any system has


How files work in genreal:
-> Can read
-> Can write
-> And can execute it

-rwx rw- r--(Command level privelages for files:
- rwx(Admin level command): Original owner can: READ, WRITE, AND EXECUTE THE FILE
rw(command for the group): Group (not sure what group) can READ AND WRITE THE FILE
r--(command accessible to all): locals can ONLY READ THE FILE

Level of Privelages:
u - user
g - group
o -other (Everyone else, the locals

How to change the levels of privelege for modificatios of files and documents:

chmod: ALlows you to change the levl of privelage for use
(How to add permissions)EX: chmod o+w (your file or directore name) 
(How to take away permissions)EX: chmod o-w (your file or directore name) 

(How to configure all permissions):
4 - stands for "read"
2 - stands for "write"
1 - stands for "execute"
0 - stands for "no permisions
7 - stands for "Give the ability of all permissions

NOTE: YOU CAN ADD NUMBERS TO ACHIEVE PLACEMENT FOR ADDNG PERMISIONS
	EX: 754
	5 IS = 4, READ, + 1, EXECUTE, -rx

OR... YOU CAN JUST USE THE LETTERS TO


How to call up written code in the terminal to do something
-> Go to the file's directory
->use the syntax: (language name) (filename.(yourfile type)

	EX: python dsr100-tsts.py

TAB: Simply hit tab for the terminal to assume what you are typing. This also pulls up ALL possible commands for each letter alphebatized
	commands
lcd: ALlows you to change local directories. A directory, the parent, has other directories, the children. YOu can change between
	the offspring directories using lcd, which is not cd, which allows you to change parrent directories

How to compress and extract files in the CLI:
TIP: When trying to interact with files or irectories that have spaces, add a slash
EX: Me\ in\ this\ house

gzip: Compresses fils
	EX: gzip (files name)
gunzip: Extracts files 
	EX: gunzip (filename).gz

Terminal interaction:
ctrl-shift-T: opens new tab in your terminal
ctrl-shift-N: Opens New terminal from current terminal

How to compress multiple files into a file type (.tar, .gz, .py, etc):
cvs:
c(Create mode): creates something
v(Display output): Displays output to the terminal
f(FIle options):
x(Extract): Extracts compressed files (for tar we know so far, just use gunzip for .gz files) 

	HOW TO DO THIS FOR TAR FILES:
	EX: tar cvf (creates and displays that file type) (Directory location) (enter your files
	EX: tar cvf Storemyfileshere.tar Grocery\ list favoritememe

	IF YOU WANT TO EXTRACT:
	EX: tar cvf (location)

How to set up different user accounts:
sudo useradd: Adds new user
	EX: sudo useradd Lini

Groups in Linux Shell: Allows permission setting for a class of users
Each file created has the owner, and the group. By default the owner belongs to that group
	Users of that group can also have access to the files on the system
	However you can add or remove users from that group, or simply make a new group with 
	New users, giving them permission to access the files and directories

groupadd: adds group to the user's system
usermod: Allows you to modify permissions for users
	EX: sudo groupadd (name your group)
	    (Enter in your password)
	    sudo usermod
-a: append, to add user
-G: add user to another group
-g: change primary group of the user (adds her to another group, she becmoes a member of 2 groups)
	EX: sudo groupadd SpecialC
	   (enter your password)
 	sudo usermod -a(to add or subtract) -g (the group name) (user you wish to add to the group

sudo userdel: Deletes user from the system
		EX: sudo userdel (user name)

NOTE: TO GO BACK MORE THAT ONE DIRECTORY SIMPLY USE (cd ../..) the slash adds another jump back 


How to find out where passwords are stored:

Go into directory (/), then enter the directory etc
Next sudo cat shadow, which shows all the encripted passwords in the system

Password symbols:
:x: = All passwords are stored in file shadow
:*: = User can't login (other purposes
NOT HAVING AN :x: SIGNIFIES THAT THERE IS NO PASSWORD, LEAVING A VULNERABILITY


file name (passwd): displays all Id information about everythign encrypted in the system
file name (shadow): contains the actual encrypted passwords

How to list all running processes

ps: process that lists all running processes
	EX: 
	ps (hit enter)

	 PID  TTY          TIME   CMD
 	2881  pts/4    00:00:00   bash
	20007 pts/4     00:00:00  ps

	PID: asssigns running processes ID's
	TTY: Terminal where the process is running from
	TIME: cpu time the process took up (number increases as more cpu time/stress is used)
	
	

ps ax: shows you all running processes you own, as well as ones in the background, etc etc
	EX: ps ax (hit enter)

How to initiate a process:
	EX: (THE PROCESSE'S NAME) (hit enter)
		xlogo

NOTE: WHEN YOU INITIATE A PROCESS FROM THE TERMINAL, YOU CANNOT REGAIN CONTROL OF THE TERMINAL UNTIL TEH PROCESS IS DONE RUNNING. USE CONTROL C TO END PROGRAM

How to run a program in the background of the terminal
	EX: (THE PROCESSE'S NAME) &
		xlogo &

		[2] 20146
		([2] = job number attatched to proess ID)
		Job:The type of process that is running


fg %:Allows you to regain control of the process and terminate it manually from the terminal
fg(for ground): brings background running processes back to user control
ctrl-z: freezes/halts a proccess the program itself will not respond when you interact with it

NOTE: fg %1, for ctrl-z, will resume the program with any actions you tried to make. Meaning if
you tried to close the program at some point the program will continue running and read your last
commands.

kill: ALlows you to kill running processess using the process ID, the PID
	EX: kill 20260 (PID for xlogo)
	    kill -STOP (PID) (this freezes the process)
	    kill -CONT (PID) (this resumes the process)
NOTE: YOU CAN ONLY KILL PROCESSES YOU OWN
	TO KILL SYSTEM PROCESS USE SUDO
	EX: sudo kill (process)

Directory (/): the heart of all main processes
Directory (~): The main directory for accessing your user account's directories. 


How to "locate" and find something in either existing directoy "~" or "/"

locate: Locates an existing item or file on the user profile

EX: locate rockyou.txt
The command will pull up the following directory location

	/usr/share/.... etc etc
