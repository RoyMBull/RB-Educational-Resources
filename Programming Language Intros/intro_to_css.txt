					color:blue;
					}
	ex: <p> some <span> content is </span> in here </p>

						text color changed to blue
					p > ability{
									color:blue;
					}
					
external style sheet: a css file to be imported accress all html files if need be

		<link> rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheetname"
